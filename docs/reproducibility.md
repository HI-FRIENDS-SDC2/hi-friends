# Reproducibility

Here we describe our approach to make the solution reproducible and we can include the reproducibility of the solution check list.


## Reproducibility of the solution check list  

Well-documented 

- [ ] High-level description of what/who the software is for is available
- [ ] High-level description of what the software does is available
- [ ] High-level description of how the software works is available
- [ ] Documentation consists of clear, step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Documentation gives examples of what the user can see at each step e.g. screenshots or command-line excerpt
- [ ] Documentation uses monospace fonts for command-line inputs and outputs, source code fragments, function names, class names etc
- [ ] Documentation is held under version control alongside the code

Easy to install 
- [ ] Full instructions provided for building and installing any software
- [ ] All dependencies are listed, along with web addresses, suitable versions, licences and whether they are mandatory or optional
- [ ] All dependencies are available
- [ ] Tests are provided to verify that the installation has succeeded
- [ ] A containerised package is available, containing the code together with all of the related configuration files, libraries, and dependencies required. Using e.g. Docker/Singularity

Easy to use 
- [ ] A getting started guide is provided outlining a basic example of using the software e.g. a README file
- [ ] Instructions are provided for many basic use cases
- [ ] Reference guides are provided for all command-line, GUI and configuration options

Open licence 
- [ ] Software has an open source licence e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL), BSD 3-Clause
- [ ] Licence is stated in source code repository
- [ ] Each source code file has a licence header

Have easily accessible source code
- [ ] Access to source code repository is available online
- [ ] Repository is hosted externally in a sustainable third-party repository e.g. SourceForge, LaunchPad, GitHub: Introduction to GitHub
- [ ] Documentation is provided for developers

Adhere to coding standards 
- [ ] Source code is laid out and indented well
- [ ] Source code is commented
- [ ] There is no commented out code
- [ ] Source code is structured into modules or packages
- [ ] Source code uses sensible class, package and variable names
- [ ] Source code structure relates clearly to the architecture or design

Utilise tests 
- [ ] Source code has unit tests
- [ ] Software recommends tools to check conformance to coding standards e.g. A ‘linter’ such as PyLint for Python

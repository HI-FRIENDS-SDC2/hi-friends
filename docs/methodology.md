## Check conformance to coding standards 

Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and looks for code smells (see [Pylint documentation](http://pylint.pycqa.org/). 
It can be installed by running 
```
pip install pylint
```
If you are using Python 3.6+, upgrade to get full support for your version:
```
pip install pylint --upgrade
```
For more information on Pylint installation see [Pylint installation](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html)

We runned Pylint in our source code.
